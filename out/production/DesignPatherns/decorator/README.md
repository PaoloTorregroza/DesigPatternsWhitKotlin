# Decorator
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for 
extending functionality.

### My example
You are a mechanical keyboard artisan, and you want to easily
get the total cost of each order.

All keyboards must have at least a case

- Plastic case: 40$
- Wood case: 45$

And may have one or more of the following

- Red switches: 15$
- Blue switches: 12.5$
- Brown switches: 20$

- PBT keycaps 40$
- ABS keycaps 25$
