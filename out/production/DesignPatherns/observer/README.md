# Observer design pattern

Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that one object
changes state, all its dependents are notified and updates 
automatically

### My example
In the village where you live, dragons, orcs, 
or other threats to cause trouble occasionally 
come. The guard who is all day in the tower observing
the surroundings has to warn the villagers and the 
guards if there are any upcoming threats or not.
